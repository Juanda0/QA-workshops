# Workshop 1 - Topicos Avanzados de Ingenieria de Software
This workshop focuses on building a robust and maintainable automated testing framework using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, Selenium WebDriver, and JUnit 5 within a Maven project structure.

## Team Members:
This project was collaboratively developed by the following members:

- **Andres Salazar Galeano**
- **Juan David Echeverri Villada**
- **Juan Sebastian Guerra Hernandez**

## Technologies Used
- Java: Programming language used for writing test scripts.
- Selenium WebDriver: Tool for automating web browser interactions.
- JUnit 5: Testing framework for writing and running tests.
- Maven: Build automation and dependency management tool.
- WebDriverManager: Library for automating the management of browser drivers.
- Brave Browser: Chromium-based browser used for running tests.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up and running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven: For building and managing project dependencies.
- Brave Browser: Chromium-based browser used for running tests. You can download it here.
- IDE (Optional): An Integrated Development Environment like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for easier code management.

## Page Object Model
The Page Object Model (POM) design pattern is implemented to enhance the maintainability and readability of the test code. Each page of the application is represented by a separate class containing locators and methods to interact with that page.


### Benefits of POM
- Separation of Concerns: Keeps test scripts clean by separating test logic from page interactions.
- Reusability: Common page actions can be reused across multiple tests.
- Maintainability: Easier to update locators and methods if the UI changes.
